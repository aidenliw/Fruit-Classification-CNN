The instruction of executing the code:

1. Import Image data (fruit_train.npz file is requred to execute the code)
Method I: 
 - Download the original image data (107 MB) from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/fruit-recognition 
 - Execute the code from FruitImageCompressor.ipynb to generate the compressed file fruit_train.npz (288 MB), it may take several minutes.
Method II:
  - Download fruit_train.npz (288 MB) from https://mega.nz/file/QKp3nKwJ#MsqiZBOiBBTfu0AdYZAT1nP7HLa1WwxcbObnM7TrGJI
  - fruit_train.npz is the key file for us to retrive image data in an efficient way.

2. Execute the code from FruitClassification_HyperparameterTuning.ipynb to see the results of hyperparameter tuning
3. Execute the code from FruitClassification_FeatureAnalysis.ipynb to see the results of Data Augmentation and Feature Analysis
